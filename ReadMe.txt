A Windows Phone application that can be used to track the location of all members in a group. A group leader creates a session and all members join it. Thereafter, if any member goes out of the specified radius, the leader gets a notification along with a location alert so that the group can find the member out of range. 
Very useful for trekking groups or used by tour guides. Can also be used by parents to monitor the movement of their babies
